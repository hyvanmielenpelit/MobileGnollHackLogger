# Overseer AI Intelligence Benchmark Feature

The AI Intelligence Benchmark subsystem in Overseer provides automated, reproducible evaluation of AI models against domain-specific roguelike game knowledge, spoilers, monster/item stats, and C codebase logic for GnollHack.

---

## 1. Architectural Overview

The benchmark framework consists of:
- **Suites & Questions**: Configurable collections of questions stratified across difficulty tiers (`Simple`, `Intermediate`, `Advanced`), with AI-assessed difficulty scores ($1\text{--}100$).
- **Multi-Dimensional BARS Assessment**: Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (0–6) evaluated across four distinct dimensions:
  - **Accuracy** (Weight: 55%)
  - **Completeness** (Weight: 25%)
  - **Conciseness** (Weight: 10%)
  - **Readability** (Weight: 10%)
- **Critical Error Ceiling**: If an answer contains critical hallucinations, dangerous commands, or complete fabrications, its overall Quality Score is hard-capped at the critical error ceiling (default: 25).
- **Logarithmic Speed Decay**: Response speed is graded relative to a target latency (default: 5,000 ms) using $Speed = \text{clamp}(100 - k \cdot \log_2(\text{DurationMs} / \text{TargetMs}), 1, 100)$.
- **Pipelined Evaluation & Concurrency Control**: Evaluator assessments are pipelined concurrently with candidate answer generation when candidate and assessor models use separate API keys, while safely serializing when sharing a rate-limit semaphore permit.
- **Provider Error Isolation**: Distinguishes between genuine model errors (wrong answers, hallucinations) and transient API infrastructure failures (HTTP 429 rate limits, 503 service unavailable, 529 overload). Provider errors are excluded from scores and denominators.
- **Configurable Scoring Profiles**: Entities defining weights, level-to-score mappings, critical error ceilings, speed target latencies, decay factors, and maximum parallel questions.
- **Exportable Markdown Reports**: Generates comprehensive 7-section Markdown reports containing run manifests, results summaries with Intelligence and Speed indices, question replies, tool traces, scoring methodology, and final qualitative synthesis.

## 2. BARS Rating Scales & Score Mapping

Levels are scored on a 7-point scale mapped non-linearly to 100 points:

| Level | Score | Anchor Definition |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | `1` | Completely incorrect, nonsensical, irrelevant, or fabricated. |
| **1** | `15` | Major inaccuracies with isolated correct fragments; misleading. |
| **2** | `35` | Partially correct but significant errors or critical omissions. |
| **3** | `55` | Mostly correct; minor inaccuracies, omissions, or slight hallucination. |
| **4** | `72` | Fully correct and clear; covers standard gameplay/code accurately. |
| **5** | `87` | Comprehensive and insightful; accurate C macro/logic understanding. |
| **6** | `100` | Flawless, authoritative, concise, and perfectly formatted. |

### Aggregation Formulas:
- **Quality Score**: $\text{Quality} = A^{0.55} \cdot C^{0.25} \cdot Cn^{0.10} \cdot R^{0.10}$ (capped at 25 if `criticalError` is true).
- **Speed Score**: $\text{Speed} = \text{clamp}(100 - 25 \cdot \log_2(\text{DurationMs} / 5000), 1, 100)$.
- **Intelligence Index**: $\sum(\text{Difficulty}(q) \cdot \text{Quality}(q)) / \sum(\text{Difficulty}(q))$.
- **Speed Index**: $\sum(\text{Difficulty}(q) \cdot \text{Speed}(q)) / \sum(\text{Difficulty}(q))$.

## 3. Data Model & Relationships

```
BenchmarkScoringProfile (1)
       │
       └───< (N) BenchmarkRun (1) ───< (N) BenchmarkRunAnswer
                       ▲
                       │
BenchmarkSuite (1) ────┴───< (N) BenchmarkQuestion
```

- **`BenchmarkScoringProfile`**: Name, `IsDefault`, dimensional weights, `LevelScoresJson`, `CriticalErrorCeiling`, `SpeedTargetMs`, `SpeedDecayK`, `MaxParallelQuestions`.
- **`BenchmarkSuite`**: Unique suite name, description (accepts Markdown, rendered as sanitized HTML), timestamps, and questions.
- **`BenchmarkQuestion`**: Order index, question text, difficulty tier, `AssessedDifficulty` ($1\text{--}100$), `AssessedDifficultyModel`, `AssessedDifficultyAtUtc`, expected rubric points.
- **`BenchmarkRun`**: Tested and assessor snapshot fields, run status, `QualityIndex`, `SpeedIndex`, `TotalAnswerDurationMs`, `ScoringProfileId`, `ScoringProfileSnapshotJson`, `ScoringMethodVersion`, `DifficultyFallbackUsed`, `SpeedMeasurementDegraded`, `MaxParallelQuestionsUsed`, token accounting, and assessment synthesis.
- **`BenchmarkRunAnswer`**: Order index, question text, sanitized visible answer text, thought text (reasoning), dimensional levels (0–6), dimensional scores, `QualityScore`, `SpeedScore`, `CriticalError`, `AssessedDifficulty`, `AssessmentStatus`, assessor comment, and token/duration metrics.

### Content Rendering & Security Principles
Rendering policy strictly depends on content author:
- **Administrator-Authored Content** (Suite descriptions & names): Authored as Markdown and rendered as sanitized HTML via `MarkdownPipe` (`marked` + `DOMPurify`).
- **AI-Generated Content** (Candidate model answers, thought reasoning text, assessor evaluations): Untrusted external completions rendered strictly as **plain text** within `<pre>` containers, never through `[innerHTML]`.

> **Note on Default Suite Re-Import:** Updating `BenchmarkDefaultSuite.json` does not automatically modify previously imported database rows. To reflect updated default suite descriptions or questions, re-import the default suite or edit existing suites manually.

## 5. AI Provider Terms Compliance Controls

The AI Intelligence Benchmark subsystem incorporates technical controls and auditable intent records to ensure operations represent internal model evaluation rather than data extraction, distillation, or training dataset harvesting.

### Summary of Applicable Provider Terms (Snapshot: 2026-09-01)
- **Anthropic** (Commercial Terms §D.4): Prohibits accessing services to train competing AI models or reverse engineer services. Prohibits Anthropic from training on Customer Content.
- **Google** (Gemini API Terms): Prohibits using services to develop competing models or reverse engineering/replicating components or parameter weights.
- **OpenAI** (Terms of Use): Prohibits using model output to develop competing models.

### Evaluation vs. Distillation Analysis
The benchmark performs domain evaluation:
- Outputs are not used to train, fine-tune, distill, or develop any AI model.
- Model completions are scored using an assessor model and formatted as Markdown reports for human administrator review to configure model selection in Overseer.
- Queries are ordinary single-turn requests evaluating domain understanding (NetHack/GnollHack mechanics and C source code).

### Technical Controls Enforced in Code
1. **Structural Growth Caps**:
   - `MaxQuestionsPerSuite` (Default: 50): Prevents question suites from expanding into scraping/harvesting pipelines. Enforced on manual question creation, suite duplication, and default suite import.
   - `MaxRunsPerHour` (Default: 5) & `MaxRunsPerDay` (Default: 20): Evaluated across all suites and models. Reaching either cap returns `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` with a clear explanation naming the hit cap and configured limit.
   - Bounded store: Daily maximum data ingestion cannot exceed $20 \text{ runs} \times 50 \text{ questions} = 1,000 \text{ answers/day}$ even under continuous utilization.
2. **Same-Provider Evaluation Gate**:
   - When the tested model and assessor model share an AI provider (e.g., Google assessing Google, or Anthropic assessing Anthropic), `POST /api/admin/benchmark/runs` returns `HTTP 409 Conflict` with provider details.
   - The administrator must review and explicitly acknowledge the same-provider methodological notice (`acknowledgeSameProvider: true`).
   - Acknowledged status is persisted on `BenchmarkRun.SameProviderAcknowledged` and disclosed in generated reports.
3. **Auditable Purpose Statement**:
   - `Benchmark:Compliance:PurposeStatement` is recorded at execution time on `BenchmarkRun.PurposeStatementUsed` and included in every exportable Markdown report.
4. **Visible Footprint & Manual Bulk Deletion**:
   - Retention is indefinite by design to maintain historical evaluation records without automated purges.
   - To keep storage visible and actionable, each suite displays its stored footprint (run count and total answer character count) alongside a bulk deletion control (`DELETE /api/admin/benchmark/suites/{id}/runs`).

### Limits of Assessment
- Snapshot date: 2026-09-01. Click-through terms change over time.
- Enterprise agreements: Negotiated enterprise agreements override standard click-through terms.
- Engineering risk reduction: Automated abuse detection systems trigger on traffic shapes; rate caps and low concurrency protect API accounts from false-positive flags.

### Re-evaluation Triggers
Compliance review must be revisited if:
1. Benchmark results or comparisons are published externally as competitive claims.
2. Benchmark completions are used for automated ingestion, distillation, or downstream model tuning.
3. Daily run volumes or suite question sizes are increased by orders of magnitude.
4. AI providers update commercial use or evaluation terms.
